IdeaTech - Idea Lab Explore and Innovate

Project Overview
IdeaTech is a dynamic web application developed for the Idea Lab in our college to provide students with easy access to the labâ€™s resources and equipment. The platform aims to enhance students' understanding of various machines like PCB laser cutting, 3D printing, CO2 laser cutting, and more, by providing manuals, video tutorials, and a platform to manage machine availability.

The application streamlines lab access, admin management, and workshop coordination for students, teachers, and staff. With CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and a fully integrated backend and frontend, IdeaTech makes the Idea Lab more efficient and accessible to all students and faculty.
